# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation Analysis using clustering and unsupervised learning techniques. By examining the "Wholesale customers" dataset, we aim to extract valuable insights into annual spending trends across various product categories.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project include:

- Performing K-Means clustering to group customers based on their spending behavior.
- Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data visualization.
- Evaluating cluster quality using silhouette scores.
- Gaining insights into customer segments to inform business strategies.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project can be found at the following source:
[Wholesale customers dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wholesale+customers)

## Project Files

The main files in this project are:

- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis.
- `Wholesale customers data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes various Python libraries, including:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tasks, including K-Means clustering and PCA.
- `plotly` and `dash`: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- `jupyter-dash`: To integrate Dash with Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
